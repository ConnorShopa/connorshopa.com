                    Shopa. 2024. Montreal.

                    <h4>
                        Every morning, I build a fire and begin again.
                    </h4>
                    <h5 class="bodyText">
                        Smarter humans than I, have told me I will have more than one job during my life. Whether that
                        means jobs spanning different disciplines, or whether that means jobs for different companies,
                        these brilliant folk did not make a difference. Being not as smart, I often forgot this fact and
                        instead made it a goal to find a position I enjoyed, become the master of my craft, and die the
                        best fit for this ever-lasting role.
                        Before I’d even graduated, I began working in a role, everyday attempting to end the day a
                        slightly better designer and human than I had started it. Every morning I would wake to a new
                        sun, and seek out how to become a better version of myself. The steps I took were frequently
                        small, infrequently large, yet always in the right direction. I was surrounded by other humans,
                        more talented, more full of wisdom, more refined than myself. Like a sapling, I soaked up every
                        drop of expertise, experience, and polish that I could, and grew. It was not my own doing that I
                        have become something new, and therefore require something new.
                        Recently, the life-fact of metamorphosis and new jobs has returned to my mind, the catalyst
                        unknown and unimportant.
                    </h5>


                    <h4>
                        Companies have missions, why not individuals?
                    </h4>

                    <h5 class="bodyText">
                        Mission statements, cultures, and values. They're all parts of successful companies and brands.
                        They align multiple brains, from multiple backgrounds, with multiple skillsets, to an individual
                        target. I feel one thing I have gleaned during my beginnings, is that the individual can find
                        value in a mission statement, just as collectives do. While being wildly inexperienced in both
                        career and human affairs, a mission would serve as a way to align myself with where I want to
                        be, in the coming parts of my life and career trajectory. Most companies use the rule of threes,
                        three key adjectives, metaphors or descriptors that express themselves, and what they aspire to
                        be. While the number 3 is my favorite of all the numbers, I think there is power in the number
                        1. I propose a single mantra that I hope will adequately explain the reasoning behind the
                        existence of my dream job. The singular metaphor I will use is, to be a tree.
                    </h5>




                    <h4>
                        How to be a tree.
                    </h4>

                    <h5 class="bodyText">
                        A tree does many things, but most notably, it grows. From the moment it roots in soil, until the
                        moment it falls over and feeds mushrooms, it is growing. Regardless of where my life brings me,
                        I hope to continue learning, developing and becoming a better version of myself. Like a tree,
                        this is not done alone. The tree relies on it’s environment, persistence and intervention from
                        those around it to make these progressions. The tree is a sum of it’s parts. This new job, which
                        my brain can not forget, therefore, needs to be a provider of all the parts that aid me in my
                        mission of growth. A dream job would give me the chance to be surrounded by individuals that
                        nourish me in multiple facets. It’s up to the tree to absorb the nutrients around it. In my
                        case, those nutrients translate to experience, wisdom, and human characteristics.
                    </h5>


                    <h4>
                        Do trees dream?
                    </h4>

                    <h5 class="bodyText">
                        I hold dreams to the utmost importance. They create tangibility from intangible feelings and
                        thoughts. Similar to the purpose of a mission, dreams allow me to define purpose. They are
                        something to work towards, something to take steps for in hopes of one day reaching. There are
                        few jobs, or companies that I believe fit this esoteric set of requirements that I have
                        established. Spotify, is one of them. The idea Spotify represents, unlocking the potential of
                        human creativity, is a direct translation of my own dream. Enjoyment and inspiration, two words
                        that I see as the base causes for creative work, fits Spotify into the image I see when I
                        picture a dream job. This dream job sits in my mind for two reasons. The joy I find in creating
                        experiences for humans, and the inspiration I find in the company as it stands today. Working as
                        a creative member of a team that is responsible for such a large, yet personal mission would
                        truly be a dream realized. </h5>
