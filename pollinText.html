        <br> <br>

        Before I “became” a designer, (I use quotations because I believe the process of becoming something is never
        final) I studied to become a computer scientist. More specifically I spent two years at a university learning,
        and working towards a degree in computer systems engineering. The degree and the courses assigned to me covered
        many different facets of the computer engineering field. From computer hardware and the physics behind them, all
        the way to the most up to date and standardized programming languages to build efficient and state-of-the-art
        software, operating systems and compilers. While I was by no means bored by the work or teachings, I eventually
        became drawn towards the more personal and creative side of crafting computer experiences for humans.
        <br> <br>
        I swapped into a new school, in a new city, pursuing a new degree. Industrial design, with a minor in
        human-computer-interaction. At this new building in a new location, I found myself much more enjoying the work
        that I was producing, and being taught to build skills around. I forgot to look back at the things I learned in
        my not so distant, previous life as a computer scientist student.
        <br> <br>
        It wasn’t until my second-to-last year that I even opened a code editor, and it wasn’t until my final year that
        I actually wrote code that contributed to some idea that would be present in my life. I was given a project to
        create a website, that utilized the then standard and easy to pick up languages of the web. HTML, CSS and
        JavaScript. The project brief was just that, brief, only asking students to present their original design, in
        both hand drawn and design-software glory, alongside the final website. All the students, myself included, had
        sketched and designed bombastic and incredible visual experiences. However the final output was no where near
        the intended experiences. They were clunky, misaligned, and in my case, had to cut corners where the code could
        not perform the same functions that a design software so generously can. The goal of this assignment, only told
        to me and my fellow designers after the final submissions, was to show us the disparity that lies between
        designing and development.
        <br> <br>
        When I was lucky enough to become a member of a startup, this fact only became even more concrete than it had
        been. I was hired as a designer, and being a small-team, I was immediately tasked with producing and handing off
        designs for the engineering-side of the team to develop and build. The product never matched the designs. I
        originally was frustrated, but very-quickly was told that this is the way it is. Designs never match
        development. Unhappy with this truth, I asked to build small parts of designs myself, arrogantly thinking that I
        could out-engineer the engineers. I was incredibly wrong, the small thing I did build, were even more
        differential than that of the engineers. I was continuously running into the same problem that was shown to me
        in my days as a student.
        <br> <br>
        It was only then that I took this lesson to heart, and became obsessed with the notion that imagining ideas, can
        never truly be the same as building them. While I still believe that this to be true, I think there is a skill
        in mitigating the differences between a slick-polished-pixel-perfect Figma file and the
        human-used-edgecasing-breathing-behemoth live product. Instead of doing work I was never meant to do, I instead
        set out to become better at the work I was. I started relearning the bits of programming I had forgot. I read
        about why this issue exists, and what real smart folk were doing to try and mitigate it. I talked with the
        developers on the team, asking them specific questions and trying to learn their complicated language and
        building processes.
        <br> <br>
        Over time, though much trial and error, both my actual designs and the handoff of them changed. I changed my
        process to start with a grandiose idea, and then scale it back to the bare-necessities instead. This allowed for
        two things;
        <br> <br>
        The designs were easier and faster to implement, therefore leaving less room for unexplained parts or details,
        as well as creating more room for early-testing and feedback. Build something and then iterate. Not the other
        way around.
        The grandiose idea became the destination instead of the first step. Every update to a product, experience or
        screen, was a stepping stone, allowing for measured and highly annotated changes.
        <br> <br>
        This change proved itself useful for both the sanity of myself and the developers that I worked alongside. The
        base knowledge that was given to me about development early in my career trajectory proved invaluable in aiding
        my make this change.
        <br> <br>
        When I mentioned to one of these developers that I had an idea to build a simple polling application, and
        already had the designs from time ago, he was thankfully interested. His key suggestion, and the true reason
        this application exists, was to use it as an excuse to learn react. I built the entire front-end myself. All
        staying as true as I could to the original designs. While the result isn’t perfect, and sometimes is broken,
        what It did do, was add padding to my knowledge of developing, from the perspective of a designer.
