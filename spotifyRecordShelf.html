As well as the experiences of exploring and sifting through crates when I visit record-stores. This fascination has led to an idea of bringing these same experiences to Spotify. I want to create a digital manifestation of a record-crate, both for the purpose of organizing collections, as well as the joy that is discovering new content through thumbing through never-before seen things.</h5>

                <h5 class="bodyText">The most obvious use case I saw was using the new view to display an artists discography. 
                    <br> <br>The record view allows users to physically explore the artists discography. With the hopes of adding to the exploration through the addition of information about the content in focus. <br> <br> This use case of the Record View adds in filter chips, sorting of the content, extending the organization of collections and getting the listener to their destination faster.  </h5>

                <h5 class="bodyText">The second use case I applied the Record View to, was the users internal library. <br> <br> Keeping familiar controls and filters where they are today, but adding in the toggle to view their collections of playlits, albums, and saved content in a more exploratory way. <br> <br> Below the main displayed content, the user is given recommendations in the same format as their own collections. This was done with the goal of creating an experience akin to that of looking through crates of records, using Spotify's abilities to suggest similar and timely items.  </h5>

                <h5 class="bodyText">I then applied the Record View to the social abilities that Spotify currently has. <br> <br> The user can browse through what their friends are currently listening to, with more information dispalyed. This increased information has the goal of further reinforcing the exploration of music. <br> <br> Similarly, a user's library is also browsable, with contextual filters for ease of finding common ground, or discovering familiar favourites. </h5>

                </div>

                <h5 class="bodyText">What I believe to be a very applicable use case for the Record View is curated content. As an exmaple I created a collection of the 2023 grammy nominees. <br> <br> Giving the user abilities to quickly toggle the category, thumb through the relevant content, and do a deeper dive into the music they love, or music they are hearing for the first time. <br><br> It's my belief that this is the closest exmaple of reaching my original goal of creating a view of collections that offers the physical joy of searching through stacks, as well as taking advantage of Spotify's digital assets and information. </h5>

                <h5 class="bodyText"> I set out to create a digital representation of a physical joy. I decided to methodically approach this task with a process of defining a skeleton, and then applying this skeleton onto use-cases I personally believe to highlight the benefits and the areas where Record View can really shine. I think there are many other areas in Spotify that could take advantage of this kind of view, and genuinely think that it adds to the magic that music truly holds.  </h5>
